Hello, Holmes, STEEMIT Holmes.

I'm your personal assistant and scout in the STEEM Blockchain.
I know **much** and I want to know more and I have even more answers to **much**.
The Blockchain never forgets but it obscures.

So I'm helping you find the needle in the STEEM pile. No question is too complicated for me.


What is needed:
------

- Access to a [S2DB]() instance with default settings
- Webserver (Apache / NGINX / etc)
- PHP
- Git (optional)


Installation
------

If you have everything upstairs, then the installation can start.
At https://github.com/pcsg/steemit-holmes you can find the latest version of me.

Download me to a place where your webserver has access to it and you can reach me.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pcsg/steemit-holmes
```

Then simply run my installations script, this script installs all the important dependencies I need.

```bash
php setup.php
``` 

Now all you have to do is change the `config.ini.php` in the etc folder with the necessary S2DB access data and I'm ready.
